**Code Institute - Milestone Project for User-Centric Frontend Development**

I made this site to answer all the questions of people who ask me: where are you from? What can I do coming to your side? I imagined a gallery of all the most beautiful places to see and what to do in the area I come from. It is a magnifying glass on my territory often seen as sun, pizza and Camorra.

The site will focus on images, and on their interactivity that will lead us to discover the places we can visit with their description and a map that will show us how to reach them.

This project is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Developer course at The Code Institute, the main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum
of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3, along with any other technologies you would like to use.
